# Results

Technological capability evolves according to
$$
[eqn1] \dot{z} = z^{\phi} R^{\eta} \\
\dot{q} = \kappa q
$$
There is a mass $L$ of labor, which grows at rate $n$. A mass $R$ is devoted
to research. Output is simply
$$Y = z(L-R)$$Define the state variable
$$q = z^{\phi-1}L^{\eta}$$
Let the share of labor devoted to research satisfy $R = s_R L$ so that
$$[eqn2] g = \frac{\dot{z}}{z} = q s_R^{\eta}$$
The state variable $Q$ evolves according to
$$\frac{\dot{q}}{q} = \eta n - (1-\phi) g = \eta n - (1-\phi) q s_R^{\eta}$$
Executing manual override. Hope this works as seen in @[eqn1].
